d2f507afd|Yun Wang|Sun Jan 26 13:43:07 2025 +0800|rustdesk-server: add the init.d and uci file for rustdesk-server - Added an init.d file to enable automatic startup of rustdesk-server on boot. - Added a uci configuration file to uniformly control the behavior of the   rustdesk-server program and support integration with the luci application. - Since the program itself does not support custom working directories,   and OpenWRT's init.d does not have parameters to set the working   directory, using `cd` in the init script seems to be the best solution   without patching the source code. This approach will not impact   performance under the current requirements.
